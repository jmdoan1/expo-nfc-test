#
# Place this script in the same directory as your pass assets
# (pass.json, icon.png, signerCert.pem, etc.)

# Usage:
# ./create_pass.sh YourNewPassName.pkpass

# --- Configuration ---
# The name of the final .pkpass file. You can pass this as an argument.

# --- Main Script ---

# 1. Clean up old pass artifacts to ensure a fresh build.
